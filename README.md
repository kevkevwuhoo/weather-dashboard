# weather-dashboard

This app allows the user to enter a name of a city and search for the current weather and a 5 day weather forecast.

Current weather includes the name of the city, the date, the temperature, a weather icon, humidity %, wind speed (MPH), and a UV index.

5 Day Forecast includes a weather icon, the date, high temp, low temp, and humidity.

The user's search history is saved in local storage and the app's weather data is automatically populated with the user's most recent search (if there is one).
